This was in part due to a lack of organizational structure and individual presence. To address this problem we ultimately created a website, a workshop series, and style guide for YEPT.\n\nThe design thinking sessions focused primarily on determining aspects of the website and style guide. With feedback from these sessions, we were able to create a color palette that reminded users of nature and felt youthful while still conveying professionalism. This palette compliments the font choices of Proxima Nova and Source Serif Pro, which participants favored due to its mix of a clean sans serif for bold headings and a classic serif for ease of readability in the body texts. \n\nConducting usability testing with the students on the website revealed both usability issues and features they desired in their online representation, but struggled to articulate in previous design thinking sessions.",
