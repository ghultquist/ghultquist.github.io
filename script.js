This was due to a lack of organizational structure and presence. To address this problem we ultimately created a website, a workshop series, and style guide for YEPT.\n\nAs the only member with programming experience, I spearheaded the development of the website. I also led communication between my team and the high school students and led the various usability and design thinking sessions we held with them. They were awesome to work with and so enthusiastic for the projects we were working on with them!",
